                    <h1>Sleep analysis in R language</h1>
                    <p>Sleep and breastfeeding study of my daughter aged 2-16 months.<br />
                        The data is collected throught the Glow app where the father and I input data manually.<br />
                    </p>
                </header>
                <p>We started documenting data when our daughter was a little over a month old, as we navigated the
                    uncertainties of standard newborn behaviors. Being deeply engaged with her often made it difficult
                    to monitor time, and admittedly, the postpartum memory isn't exactly renowned for its reliability.
                    Reviewing the recorded data helped us determine if her fussiness stemmed from lack of sleep or
                    hunger, or if there might be another underlying issue.

                    and for the R-language <a
                        href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/grecebo/sleep-analysis-of-my-daughter-at-2-16-months">code</a>

                <h2>Sleep analysis</h2>
                <p>A summarized tile chart displays her daily sleep and breastfeeding patterns, spanning from 12 AM to
                    12 AM the following day.:
                <p>
                <!-- <div class="image main"><img src="images/Sleep_Study/sleep_bf_chart.jpeg" alt="" /></div> -->
                <a href="images/Sleep_Study/sleep_bf_chart.jpeg" target="_blank" class="image main"><img src="images/Sleep_Study/sleep_bf_chart.jpeg" alt="" /></a>
                <!-- <a href="/Sleep-study.html"  class="image main"><img src="images/Sleep_Study/sleep_bf_chart.jpeg" alt="" /></a> -->
                <p>Here is the annotated version of the 24-hour chart:
                <p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images//Sleep_Study/sleep_bf_chart_annotated.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>We began implementing a sleep schedule when she was 6.5 months old. By extending her wake periods,
                    she seamlessly adapted to the new routine from day one. Initially, we aimed for a three-nap
                    schedule, but her naps were so extended that fitting in a third nap became impossible.<br />
                    At 14 months, she started kindergarten, necessitating a shift to a one-nap routine. This adjustment
                    proved challenging as she wasn't accustomed to longer wakeful periods, leading to some cranky
                    evenings. However, after about two weeks, she settled comfortably into the new routine.
                <p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Sleep_Study/Sleep_Duration_per_Day.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>From the sleep duration graph, we can see a rise in her daily sleep duration until the third month,
                    likely a result of her mastering nap linking. The introduction of a sleep schedule at 6.5 months
                    appears to have had a marginally positive impact on her sleep length. Post the 14-month mark, the
                    graph displays increased fluctuations, possibly due to her daytime naps at the kindergarten. There,
                    she naps outdoors in a stroller, exposing her to more potential disturbances. Conversely, at home
                    during weekends, she enjoys an optimal nap environment in her bed, with blackout curtains and white
                    noise ensuring a superior nap experience. <br />
                    Overall, she seems to have slept soundly, with only brief night-time awakenings for breastfeeding.
                </p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Sleep_Study/Sleep_Duration_per_Day_by_Sleep_Type.jpeg"
                        alt="" /></div>
                <p>In the 'Sleep Duration by Sleep Type' chart, I've categorized her sleep into 'Night Sleep' and
                    'Naps'. It's evident that her night sleep stabilized from the third month onward, while her nap
                    durations saw a significant decline from the third month, leveling off from the fifth month.
                    However, upon starting kindergarten, her nap durations began to decrease once more.
                <p>
                <h2>Breastfeeding analysis</h2>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Sleep_Study/Daily_Breastfeeding_Duration.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>From the 24-hour chart, her breastfeeding appears somewhat sporadic. However, a discernible pattern
                    emerges, with feedings often occurring just before and after naps. Since she began kindergarten, she
                    hasn't been breastfeeding during those hours, but the pattern persists during weekends.
                    Interestingly, the duration of breastfeeding hasn't decreased with her start at kindergarten. In
                    fact, there are indications of an uptick. This could perhaps be attributed to her seeking more
                    comfort and closeness after spending time in the kindergarten environment.
                <p>
                <div class="image main"><img src="images/Sleep_Study/No_of_Breastfeedings_a_Day.jpeg" alt="" /></div>
                <p>Interestingly, while the duration of breastfeeding has remained relatively consistent, the frequency
                    of breastfeeding sessions has seen more fluctuations. A noticeable increase is evident in the recent
                    months. This could be attributed to her time in kindergarten. However, another contributing factor
                    could be the 15-month vaccine, to which she had a reaction, manifesting as a fever, development of a
                    rash, and
                    increased fussiness.
                <p>
                <p>Overall, delving into this dataset was both enlightening and a valuable exercise in R programming. It
                    provided insights into her sleep and breastfeeding patterns.</p>
